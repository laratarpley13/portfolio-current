            <!-- <p>
                I started my coding journey in high school with Javascript 
                and then went on to learn some Python while in school completing 
                my undergraduate degree. While I ended up deciding to major in 
                Economics at the time, these introductions to coding were key things
                that would spark my interest to pursue web development as a career.
            </p> -->
            <!-- <p>
                After completing my undergratuate degree in Economics, I decided that I did not 
                want to pursue it as a career field and was determined to find a 
                field that I was passionate about and get a lot of joy from. So, while I 
                was exploring my options I started playing around with code again in my free time 
                and exploring resources online about web development and I found 
                myself wanting to keep challenging myself to make better web applications 
                and now, after a lot of learning about code, I am pursuing a career as a web developer.

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I am a web developer currently based in Austin, TX.</p>
                <p>
                    I think web development is a wonderful mix of both creativity and logic 
                    and a field in which you will always be learning something new, and those 
                    are major things that drew me to the field, as I am always ready for my 
                    next coding challege and watching my work come to life with the help and 
                    support of a team of fellow web developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of coding, you will most likely find me in the kitchen 
                    developing and creating new recipes and dishes to share with friends 
                    and family or enjoying the outdoors whether that is a nice hike or 
                    reading a good book at a park.

                            I love to cook and create new recipes and wanted a platform
                            that would make it easy for anyone to share their recipe creations and recieve constructive feedback 
                            on the recipes in the form of pictures, as I feel like food can be a very visual experience.

                            other people's recipes and leave them feedback as well.

                            Inspired by my family, who like to make hand-written to-do and shopping lists, but when it comes 
                            time to use them to share with each other it makes it difficult to keep track 
                            of who is in charge of each task. So I wanted to make an easy to use list maker that 
                            also allows you to share the list with someone else and can see when each other accomplishes 
                            a certain task.

                            I love to read, but often times I have a hard time figuring out what I would like to read. 
                            So I wanted to create an application that gave users a different medium in the form 
                            of YouTube videos, that often include interviews with the author or book reviews, to help 
                            users decide on their next read.

                            Users can select which NYT best seller's list to look through and in return for each 
                            book on the list they will get a picture of the book cover, the name of the book, the author(s), a 
                            description, the option to display YouTube videos for the book, and a purchase link.
