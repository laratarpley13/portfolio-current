            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I am a web developer currently based in Austin, TX.</p>
            <!-- <p>
                I started my coding journey in high school with Javascript 
                and then went on to learn some Python while in school completing 
                my undergraduate degree. While I ended up deciding to major in 
                Economics at the time, these introductions to coding were key things
                that would spark my interest to pursue web development as a career.
            </p> -->
            <p>
                After completing my undergratuate degree in Economics, I decided that I did not 
                want to pursue it as a career field and was determined to find a 
                field that I was passionate about and get a lot of joy from. So, while I 
                was exploring my options I started playing around with code again in my free time 
                and exploring resources online about web development and I found 
                myself wanting to keep challenging myself to make better web applications 
                and now, after a lot of learning about code, I am pursuing a career as a web developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think web development is a wonderful mix of both creativity and logic 
                and a field in which you will always be learning something new, and those 
                are major things that drew me to the field, as I am always ready for my 
                next coding challege and watching my work come to life with the help and 
                support of a team of fellow web developers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of coding, you will most likely find me in the kitchen 
                developing and creating new recipes and dishes to share with friends 
                and family or enjoying the outdoors whether that is a nice hike or 
                reading a good book at a park.

                    I love to cook and create new recipes and wanted a platform
                    that would make it easy for anyone to share their recipe creations and recieve constructive feedback 
                    on the recipes in the form of pictures, as I feel like food can be a very visual experience.
